# train-schedule


I was unable to resolve the following error when linking to the Add Train page:

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'trim' of undefined
    at HTMLDivElement.addTrain (firebase.js:19)
    at HTMLDivElement.dispatch (jquery.js:4641)
    at HTMLDivElement.elemData.handle (jquery.js:4309)


Also, I was unable to figure out how to do the security check.
